SILO (Seed Images Location Operation) is a REST API provided by the Seed team for discovering Seed images.  The API
allows users to scan one or more repositories for seed images and then search the resulting images and their manifests
by keywords.  Frameworks such as Scale can use these endpoints to assist users in finding algorithm images and creating
jobs out of them.

== Install

To build/install the SILO webapp on linux:

----
Install go and docker packages
yum install go
yum install docker
go get github.com/JohnPTobe/silo
~/go/src/github.com/JohnPTobe/silo/install-silo.sh
----
